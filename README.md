**Where Code Meets Frappe Intelligence**

CodexFrapp is a developer-first extension framework built on top of Frappe, designed to accelerate the development of scalable, modular, and intelligent custom ERP apps. It blends clean coding principles with the smart features of the Frappe ecosystem—making it perfect for building CRMs, HR systems, Inventory modules, and more.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔧 Modular Architecture (pluggable apps and components)
- ⚙️ CLI-ready Code Scaffolding (Doctypes, Controllers, Routes)
- 🔐 Auth-ready Base Structure (JWT/Token/session options)
- 🌐 API-first Design with RESTful principles
- 🧱 Reusable Components (models, views, forms, etc.)
- 🔄 Built-in Migration and Seeder System
- 📦 Easy integration into ERPNext or custom Frappe stacks
