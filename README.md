**Where Code Meets Frappe Intelligence**

CodexFrapp is a developer-first extension framework built on top of Frappe, designed to accelerate the development of scalable, modular, and intelligent custom ERP apps. It blends clean coding principles with the smart features of the Frappe ecosystem—making it perfect for building CRMs, HR systems, Inventory modules, and more.

CodexFrapp follows the Codexsun principle: **separation of core, modules, and site logic**. Every module is built to scale independently while leveraging Frappe’s real-time and meta-driven intelligence.
